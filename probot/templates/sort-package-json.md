### Hi @{{owner}} 👋🏻

I hope you're doing well.

As an **opinionated bot**, I noticed that package.json is not **sorted**. When your package.json file is sorted properly, it becomes easier to read and maintain. It allows other developers who might be working on the project to quickly as everything is clearly organized and easy to find.

### What's in the PR ?

I've created a pull request that updates the project's [`package.json`](https://github.com/{{owner}}/{{repo}}/blob/{{branch}}/package.json), sorted using [`sort-package-json`](https://github.com/keithamus/sort-package-json). This should not break anything. In case it does, I apologize for it.

Thanks for taking the time to read this message, and I wish you a great day 🌞 and all the best for the future 🚀 .

Stay safe 🙏🏻
